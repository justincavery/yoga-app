# Practice Session Audio Files

This directory contains audio files for practice session cues.

## Audio Files Required

1. **transition-warning.mp3** - Played 5 seconds before pose transition (gentle bell sound)
2. **transition.mp3** - Played on pose change (soft chime)

## Audio Attribution

For development, you can use royalty-free sounds from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

## Development Note

For now, we'll use the Web Audio API to generate simple beep sounds programmatically.
In production, replace with professional audio files.
