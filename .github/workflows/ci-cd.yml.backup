# DEPRECATED: This file has been replaced by ci-cd-production.yml
#
# The new production-grade CI/CD pipeline is in:
# - .github/workflows/ci-cd-production.yml (main deployment)
# - .github/workflows/pull-request.yml (PR checks)
# - .github/workflows/rollback.yml (rollback capability)
# - .github/workflows/health-check.yml (monitoring)
#
# This file is kept as backup and will be removed after successful deployment.
#
# To migrate:
# 1. Configure GitHub Secrets (RAILWAY_TOKEN)
# 2. Push to main branch
# 3. New workflows will automatically trigger
# 4. After successful deployment, this file can be deleted
#
# See: .github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md for setup instructions
