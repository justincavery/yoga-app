## Step 1: Create Your Character Reference (REQUIRED FIRST!)

```

wearing gray yoga leggings and fitted gray yoga top, neutral standing pose,
facing camera, full body visible, yoga studio with wooden floor,
natural lighting, professional photography, clean background --ar 2:3 --style raw --v 6

```

**After generation:**
1. Pick the best result (upscale with U1, U2, U3, or U4)
2. Right-click the upscaled image → "Copy Image Address"
3. Save this URL - you'll use it for ALL poses below

## Step 2: Generate Each Pose with Character Consistency

**Replace `[CHARACTER_URL]` with your saved URL from Step 1**

### Format for each pose:
```
/imagine [CHARACTER_URL] [POSE PROMPT] --ar 2:3 --cref [CHARACTER_URL] --cw 100 --v 6
