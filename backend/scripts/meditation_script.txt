Find a comfortable position, letting your body settle, and gently close your eyes.


Take a deep breath in through your nose.


And breathe out slowly, releasing.


Begin by bringing your awareness to your breath, noticing the natural rhythm, the gentle rise and fall of your chest.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The soft whisper of air, moving in and out.


With each breath, feel yourself becoming heavier, more grounded, as if you're gently sinking into the earth beneath you.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


Now, bring your attention to the crown of your head. Imagine a soft, warm light beginning to glow there, like honey-colored sunlight filtering through leaves.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


This warm light begins to slowly, so slowly, melt down across your scalp, releasing any tension, smoothing away any tightness.


Feel it flow over your forehead, your eyebrows softening, your eyelids becoming heavy and peaceful.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The light continues its gentle journey, across your cheeks, along your jaw, releasing any holding, any gripping.


Your face becomes soft, smooth, like still water on a quiet morning.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The warmth flows down your neck, each vertebra releasing, one by one, like pearls on a string, gently separating.


It melts across your shoulders. These beautiful shoulders that carry so much, now they can simply let go, dropping away from your ears, becoming heavy and peaceful.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The light flows down your arms, warm and soothing, down to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and into your hands.


Your fingers tingle, perhaps with warmth, perhaps with a gentle buzzing, as if you're holding starlight in your palms.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


Now the light pools in your chest, your heart space. Breathing here becomes even softer, even gentler, like a sleeping baby's breath.


Feel your ribcage expanding and releasing, expanding and releasing, like gentle waves on a shore.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The warmth continues down your spine, each vertebra, each disc, softening, releasing.


Down through your lower back, across your hips, any tension melting away like snow in spring sunshine.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


The light flows down your thighs, warm and soothing, down to your knees, your calves, your ankles.


And finally, it reaches your feet. The soles of your feet tingling, connecting you to the earth, grounding you completely.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


Your whole body now, bathed in this warm, golden light. Every cell softening, every fiber releasing.


You are completely held, completely supported. There is nothing you need to do, nowhere you need to be.


Simply rest here, in this perfect, peaceful, present moment.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


Your breath continues its gentle rhythm, without any effort from you. Your body breathing itself, your heart beating itself.


You are safe. You are whole. You are exactly where you need to be.


Breathe in.


Breathe out.


Rest here for a few more breaths, feeling the gentle pulse of life moving through you, like a quiet river, flowing, flowing, always flowing.


And when you're ready, there's no rush, begin to deepen your breath. Perhaps wiggling your fingers and toes.


Gently, so gently, bringing movement back to your body.


And when it feels right, slowly opening your eyes, carrying this peace with you into the rest of your day.
