## Post-Production Requirements

### Image Editing Checklist
- [ ] Color correction for consistent skin tones
- [ ] Exposure adjustment
- [ ] Crop to appropriate aspect ratios (16:9 for landscape, 4:5 for portrait)
- [ ] Light retouching (remove blemishes, but maintain authentic representation)
- [ ] Background cleanup if needed
- [ ] Sharpening for web display
- [ ] Export optimized versions:
  - Thumbnail: 400px wide
  - Detail view: 1200px wide
  - Original: 3000px wide (archive)

### Quality Control
- Ensure proper form in all poses
- Check that alignment is clearly visible
- Verify lighting is consistent across all images
- Confirm diversity of models across full library

## Alternative Angles (Lower Priority)

For key poses, consider capturing additional angles:
- **Back view**: Shows posterior chain engagement
- **Overhead view**: Shows alignment from above (especially for mat-based poses)
- **Close-up details**: Hand placement, foot positioning, facial expression (calm, focused)

## Budget Considerations

### Estimated Costs
- **Studio rental**: $75-150/hour × 12 hours = $900-1800
- **Photographer**: $100-200/hour × 12 hours = $1200-2400
- **Models**: $50-100/hour × 3-4 models × 4 hours each = $600-1600
- **Props and equipment**: $200-500 (if not already owned)
- **Post-production**: $50-75/hour × 6 hours = $300-450
- **Total estimated budget**: $3,200-6,750

### Cost-Saving Alternatives
- Use natural light in a home/studio with large windows
- Recruit yoga instructor friends as models (may accept lower rates or trade)
- Photographer with yoga experience can self-model some poses
- DIY post-production if team has skills
- Phase approach: Shoot beginner poses first, add others post-launch

## Legal Requirements

### Model Releases
- Obtain signed model releases for all photography
- Specify usage rights: web, print, promotional materials
- Include social media usage permissions
- Confirm models understand images will be public

### Copyright
- Ensure photographer assigns copyright to YogaFlow or provides unlimited usage license
- Maintain organized archive of all RAW files
- Keep releases and contracts for all models and photographers

## Accessibility Considerations

### Image Descriptions
- Every photo must have descriptive alt text for screen readers
- Alt text should describe: pose name, body position, key alignment points
- Example: "Woman in Mountain Pose, standing with feet hip-width apart, arms at sides, facing forward with neutral spine"

### Visual Clarity
- High contrast between subject and background
- Clear focus on proper alignment
- No cluttered backgrounds that distract from pose
- Sufficient lighting to see form details

## Delivery Format

### Final Deliverables
1. **High-resolution originals** (RAW + full-size JPG): Archived
2. **Web-optimized images** (1200px wide): For pose detail pages
3. **Thumbnails** (400px wide): For pose library grid
4. **File naming spreadsheet**: Links pose IDs to image files
5. **Model release documentation**: Scanned PDFs

### File Organization
```
/content/images/poses/

## Notes for Photographer

### Style Guidelines

### Common Photography Mistakes to Avoid
- Shadows obscuring alignment details
- Overexposure washing out form
- Background clutter
