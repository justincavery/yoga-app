# Voice Samples Directory

Place your voice sample audio file here.

## Requirements:
- **Format**: wav, mp3, m4a, ogg, or flv
- **Length**: At least 6 seconds (longer is better for variations)
- **Quality**: Clear audio, minimal background noise
- **Content**: Natural speaking (yoga instructions, meditation guidance, or conversational)

## File naming:
Name your file something descriptive, e.g.:
- `yoga_instructor_sample.mp3`
- `voice_sample.wav`
- `meditation_voice.m4a`

## What happens next:
The script will use different segments of your clip to create natural variations in pacing and tone.
